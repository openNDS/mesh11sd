## 1. The mesh11sd project

Mesh11sd is a tool for OpenWrt users looking to create and manage wireless mesh networks using the 802.11s standard. [^1]

It helps automate the process, which can be complex, especially for those new to networking or for the more experienced wanting to rapidly deploy larger networks.

***Please read this entire document before installing the mesh11sd package!***

***Note: This documentation applies to version 5.0.0 or higher.***

## 2. Overview

### What is a Mesh Network?

A mesh network is a type of network setup where devices, or "nodes," are interconnected in a way that allows them to communicate with each other directly, without needing a central hub like a router in a traditional network.

Picture a web: each node can send, receive, and relay data to other nodes, creating multiple paths for information to travel. This makes the network flexible and resilient—if one node goes down, the others can still connect through different routes.

In practical terms, mesh networks are often used in places where reliable coverage is tricky, like large homes, outdoor areas, or even smart cities.

For example, some Wi-Fi systems use mesh technology with multiple units working together to blanket an area with signal, avoiding dead zones.

They’re also common in things like IoT (Internet of Things) devices, where gadgets need to talk to each other efficiently.

The beauty of it is the self-healing nature: the network adapts as nodes join or drop out, keeping things running smoothly. It’s less centralized, more cooperative—like a team passing a ball around until it reaches the goal. [^2]

### What is Mesh11sd

Mesh11sd is an OpenWrt package that autonomously manages all aspects of an 802.11s mesh network and its connected nodes. [^3]

The package acts as a service daemon, dynamically configuring network parameters across multiple mesh nodes and is particularly useful for simplifying setup, reducing manual configuration, and improving network reliability.

## 3. Major Features:
 1. **Auto configuration** of 802.11s mesh backhaul (Default)
 2. **Bridge Portal Mode** Configures a bridged portal (ie no ipv4 routing) and supports tunnelling of a VLAN trunk over the mesh backhaul (Optional).
 3. **Trunk Peer Mode** providing ethernet downstream VLAN support from connections to remote peers (Optional).
 4. **Customer Premises Equipment Mode (CPE)** (AKA Client Premises Equipment Mode), providing a routed peer with an upstream Internet connection via the mesh backhaul (Optional). Ideal for WISP or Community Network use cases.
 5. **Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE)**, with OWE Transition. It provides encryption for open Wi-Fi networks without requiring user authentication, enhancing security for public or guest networks (Default).
 6. **Portal-Node to Peer-Group Mode**, enabling "guest" networking over mesh backhaul without the need for setting up a VLAN (Default).
 7. **Access Point Monitoring** (AKA Mesh Gate Monitoring). Incorporates the code and functionality of the apmond package. A centralised Access Point usage database is created, enabling access point statistics, such as client connections, client data volumes etc., to be viewed on the Mesh Portal in json format (Default).
 8. **Leech Mode Peer**, enables a special type of peer that can join the mesh backhaul without contributing to the backhaul infrastructure. Useful for providing coverage "fill in" where access point signals are too weak for client devices. The Leech Mode peer forwards only the traffic of clients that are connected to it, it does not forward the traffic of other peers.

## 4. Getting Started:
To get started, you will need at least two mesh capable devices to use as meshnodes. These meshnodes should have:

 1. At least the recommended minimum flash/ram resources for the version of OpenWrt to be used.
 2. At least two ethernet ports (usually labelled wan and lan).
 3. At least one mesh compatible radio.

If you are not sure one or more devices you want to use as meshnodes are compatible with a mesh, then you can do a Confidence Test.

### Confidence Testing

Most modern router hardware supported by OpenWrt also supports 802.11s mesh under OpenWrt.

A small number do not and a small number do but lack certain advantageous features such as a reset button that would allow uboot or tftp reflashing to escape from a "bricked" situation.

Also, sometimes, configuration errors may be made, also resulting in a bricked condition.

Mesh11sd provides an escapable "Confidence Test", a basic reflash image that allows the mesh11sd daemon to be manually started in autoconfig mode. If, in the worst case, it becomes impossible to access the node being tested, a simple power cycle will restore an accessible state.

#### Enable a Confidence Test

***To enable a Confidence Test, configure the node using one of the Deployment Methods mentioned in the next section - BUT configure the auto-config option to be 0, ie disabled.***

You can then begin the test by starting an ssh terminal session and issuing the command:

        mesh11sd debuglevel 3; mesh11sd commit_changes commit; mesh11sd auto_config test; logread -f

You will now see the auto_config process in progress. If all is well you can continue with the deployment.

If the process fails and you loose contact, simply power cycle to recover the device.


### Deployment Methods

There are two deployment methods:

  1. *The Rapid Deployment firmware flash method* is the quickest and most efficient way to get a mesh network up and running.

     *This is the preferred deployment method.*

  2. *The Node by Node installation method* can also be used, but is significantly less efficient. It takes much more time and a greater in depth knowledge of OpenWrt to deploy and uses more flash space on the nodes. In addition, there is greater scope for error. There will however be little or no performance penalty if using this method.

### 4.1 Rapid Deployment Firmware Flash

An 802.11s mesh backhaul can be rapidly deployed by taking advantage of the OpenWrt Firmware Selector (or the Image Builder) and the Mesh11sd package.

We will go through the simple steps to create a flash image that contains all that is required to deploy a mesh network. We will call this network the *mesh backhaul* as it is the virtual wireless infrastructure that carries user data from one point to another in the background.

By means of an example, we will use one hardware model, but there is no requirement for all the nodes of the mesh to be the same hardware. Obviously, a flash image will have to be made for each hardware type.

#### Using The Firmware Selector to Create a Custom Image

For this example we will use the GL-iNet MT300N-V2, a tiny low cost device capable of 300Mb/s for mesh backhaul traffic.

The Firmware Selector can be found here:

https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/

Open the link in your browser.

Select the model

Select the version of OpenWrt

Click on “Customize installed packages and/or first boot script”

In the upper text box, labelled “Installed Packages”, you will see a list of packages.

At or near the end you will see wpad-basic-mbedtls. Add a minus sign (-) in front of it, ie -wpad-basic-mbedtls

At the end of the list add the following dependency packages:

  1. wpad-mbedtls
  2. px5g-mbedtls
  3. ip-full
  4. kmod-nft-bridge
  5. vxlan
  6. mesh11sd

***NOTE: If the node you are configuring uses ath10k-ct drivers, you must change to the none-ct versions. If you do not, mesh11sd will log an error to syslog and terminate.***

For our example of the GL-MT300N-V2, the upper text box, labelled "Installed Packages"  will now look like this:

```
base-files busybox ca-bundle dnsmasq dropbear firewall4 fstools kmod-gpio-button-hotplug
kmod-leds-gpio kmod-mt7603 kmod-nft-offload kmod-usb-ohci kmod-usb2 libc libgcc
libustream-mbedtls logd luci mtd netifd nftables odhcp6c odhcpd-ipv6only opkg
ppp ppp-mod-pppoe procd procd-seccomp procd-ujail swconfig uci uclient-fetch urandom-seed
urngd -wpad-basic-mbedtls wpad-mbedtls px5g-mbedtls ip-full kmod-nft-bridge vxlan mesh11sd
```

On the Firmware Selector Window, it will be similar to this screenshot (changes highlighted in blue):

![openNDS-Mesh11sd](https://github.com/openNDS/mesh11sd/blob/master/docs/images/installed-packages.png)


Now, in the lower text box, labelled "Script to run on first boot (uci-defaults)", add the following:

```
# WARNING:
# Setting auto_config to 1 enables auto_config.
# Do this when you are CONFIDENT your hardware/config combination works.
# Make sure you have read and understand the documentation.
# Otherwise, in the worst case, you might soft brick your router into a tight boot loop.

uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_config='0' # Note: This is set to 0 for Confidence Testing

uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_mesh_id='MyMeshID' # This is a secret mesh ID string of your choice.
uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_base_ssid='MyNetwork' # This is your AP SSID string
uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_encryption='1' # This selects the encryption type to use on your AP
uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_key='MyWifiCode' # This is the WiFi code to use when connecting to your AP
uci commit mesh11sd

# For security, set your root password:
rootpassword="myrootpassword"
/bin/passwd root << EOF
$rootpassword
$rootpassword
EOF
```
On the Firmware Selector Window, it will be similar to this screenshot:

![openNDS-Mesh11sd](https://github.com/openNDS/mesh11sd/blob/master/docs/images/uci-defaults-highlighted.png)

Replace MyMeshID (highlighted in red in the screenshot) with a secret mesh id string of your choice. This is used as a seed for generating secure keys to be used for encrypting all traffic on the mesh backhaul.

Replace MyNetwork (highlighted in red in the screenshot) with a base SSID to use for all Mesh Gate Access Points. This must be a maximum of 22 characters in length, excess characters will be truncated.

Replace MyWifiCode (highlighted in red in the screenshot) with a wifi access code you will use for connecting user devices to the Mesh Gate Access Points.

Replace myrootpassword (highlighted in red in the screenshot) with a secret root password of your choice.

***NOTE:*** Selecting mesh_gate_encryption='0' will enable OWE Transition mode, supporting “Enhanced Open” encryption on client devices that support it (almost all recent ones) or falling back to legacy “open unencrypted” for those that don't.

OWE is ideal for “guest” type systems and public venues, providing a level of security previously not available.

#### Guest Network

Mesh11sd creates an additional, independent "Guest" network (ssid Guestxgxxxx).

The Guest network will use OWE Transition security by default.

For a full list of setup options, including turning off the Guest network, see sections 9 and 10 below.

#### Request Your Firmware Build

On the Firmware Selector page, click “REQUEST BUILD” to build your customised firmware.

Once the firmware build has completed, you should download it and re-flash all your meshnode devices (of the same hardware type).

If you have more than one hardware type, repeat the above build process for each type, keeping the configuration the same between types.

You can now deploy Your MeshNodes.

A portal node will have its wan port connected to a lan port on the upstream (isp) router which provides your Internet feed.


#### Deployment Options for your meshnodes.

There are two main deployment options.

1. As a fully routed mesh network with an Internet feed uplink connected to the wan port of one of the nodes. This is the default option.

2. As a mesh extension of an existing local area network with a link to the existing lan connected to the lan port of one of the nodes. This is known as "Bridge Portal Mode", and is selected by setting option portal_detect to 4 ONLY on the portal device - if required this should be changed only after testing with the live mesh backhaul is complete.


Connect an ethernet patch lead, on just one meshnode, to its wan port.

Connect the other end of the patch lead to a lan port of your isp or existing router, and power up the node.

This node will autoconfigure as a portal node, routing ip traffic from the isp or other router's lan to the new mesh backhaul subnet. The ipv4 subnet is automatically set by the autoconfigure process 

### Open a Terminal Session on the Node

For this we need the Link Local ipv6 address.

#### Getting the Link Local ipv6 address of the portal node.

As most nodes will autoconfigure to be a portal mode if provided with an upstream ethernet connection, it is important to realise that the ipv4 subnet is configured based on the hash of the mac address of the node and will not be recognisable or easy to guess.

However the ipv6 link local address will be unique to the node regardless of the autoconfigured node type. The last four hex digits of the ipV6 will be the same as, (or in the case of some hardware types be recognisably similar to) the last four digits of the mac address on the label.

Having reflashed the meshnode you want to be the portal node, ie the one that is going to have the upstream ethernet connection, connect the upstream ethernet to wan and your computer to lan and power it on. Wait for it to boot up, could be a minute or so....

On your computer, It should request and receive an ipv4 address via DHCP. Look at the routing table.

**On Linux this would be ip -6 route.** (See later for Windows)

Look for a line in the output with the keyword "via".

For example you might see:

        default via fe80::9683:c4ff:fea2:8ecb dev enp3s0f3u2u4 proto ra metric 20100 pref medium

It may take a few minutes to appear and initially may not say "default".

Re-run the command if necessary.

In this example, the link local ipv6 address is:

        fe80::9683:c4ff:fea2:8ecb

and the ethernet interface is:

        enp3s0f3u2u4

So the full ipv6 address to use from your computer would be:

        fe80::9683:c4ff:fea2:8ecb%enp3s0f3u2u4

Obviously you would substitute the values you found.

To start an ssh terminal window for the device, you would run:

        ssh root@fe80::9683:c4ff:fea2:8ecb%enp3s0f3u2u4

**On Windows this would be the ipconfig command**

 1. Open Command Prompt: Press Windows Key + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
 2. Run the command: Type ipconfig and press Enter.
 3. Look for the IPv6 Default Gateway: Scroll through the output. Find the network adapter you’re using (e.g., "Ethernet adapter" or "Wireless LAN adapter"). Under that section, look for "Default Gateway."
 4. It’ll look something like fe80::9683:c4ff:fea2:8ecb%8 or similar, the number after the % will be the interface number.

To start an ssh terminal window for the device, first you must ensure the ssh client software is installed.

 1. Open cmd (press Windows Key + R, type cmd, and hit Enter).
 2. Type ssh and press Enter. If it shows usage info (e.g., "usage: ssh [-46Aaf..."), the SSH client is already installed.
 3. If you get "'ssh' is not recognized," you’ll need to enable it.
       * Go to Settings > Apps > Optional Features.
       * Click "Add a feature," search for "OpenSSH Client," install it, and restart cmd.

You can now start the ssh terminal window using the command.

Substituting the values you obtained from ipconfig:

        ssh root@fe80::9683:c4ff:fea2:8ecb%8

Once you have logged in to the ssh terminal session, you can check the status by running the command:

        mesh11sd status

#### Power up the other meshnodes

When you are ready, place all the other meshnodes in their desired locations, with at least pairs of nodes within range of each other.

Power them all up and wait for a few minutes for booting to complete and the mesh backhaul to establish.

#### The Mesh Backhaul Heartbeat LED Indicator

On most hardware types of meshnode, the power or status led will begin to flash in a distinctive heartbeat sequence once is is in communication with at least one other meshnode on the mesh backhaul.

#### Additional Alternative Setup Options

**CPE mode**

One of the most useful options in a “Community” or “Public” mesh network is CPE mode.
CPE mode (Customer[Client] Premises Equipment, is a special configuration mode for a mesh gate, where the gate provides a nat routed ipv4 network for clients.

For CPE mode, enter the following into the Firmware Selector lower text box:

```
uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_config='1'
uci set mesh11sd.setup.portal_detect='3'
uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_base_ssid='MyNetwork'
uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_mesh_id='MyMeshID'
uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_encryption='1'
uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_key='MyWifiCode'
uci commit mesh11sd
rootpassword="myrootpassword"
/bin/passwd root << EOF
$rootpassword
$rootpassword
EOF
```

**Other modes**

There are also numerous other setup options that can be added to the configuration, such as the wireless band to use, the backhaul channel, the mesh path cost etc.
Full details can be seen here: https://github.com/openNDS/mesh11sd/tree/master#10-setup-options


### 4.2 Node by Node Installation

Reflash the first one of your meshnodes with the standard OpenWrt image and allow it to boot up making sure it is connected to your upstream Internet feed **using its wan port** and that you get Internet access when connected to (one of) its lan ports.

**Note**: The OpenWrt default is for all wireless interfaces to be disabled. You do not have to enable them here as the mesh11sd daemon will do it for you.

**Note**: If you cannot get Internet access you may need to change the ipv4 subnet of either this meshnode or your isp router.

You are now ready to install mesh11sd and its supporting packages. None of these support packages are essential, but without them there will be much reduced functionality in the resulting mesh network. For example, the mesh backhaul may NOT be encrypted.

Log in to a terminal session on the meshnode using ssh.
Using the normal OpenWrt method (opkg or apk), update the repository databases (`opkg update` or `apk update`).

Now do the following:

 1. Remove the wpad-basic-mbedtls package.
 2. Install the wpad-mbedtls package.
 3. Activate the new wpad daemon using the command `service wpad restart`
 4. Install the ip-full package.
 5. Install the kmod-nft-bridge package.
 6. Install the vxlan package
 . Install the uhttpd and px5g-mbedtls packages (may already be installed along with the LuCi UI).
 7. Finally - Install the mesh11sd package.

The mesh11sd daemon should now be running in a "safe" state (aka "manual mode").

Now we need to login to the node to configure it. To do this, follow the section "Open a Terminal Session on the Node" above.

For security, you should now use the `passwd` command to set the root password on the node.

The next step is to run a Confidence Test. To do this, follow the section "Enable a Confidence Test" above.

If this is successful we can now set the final auto_config state for the node. Run the command:

`mesh11sd auto_config enable`

Repeat everything in this section for all the other meshnodes.


## 5. Important Considerations

Before activating the mesh11sd service daemon, there are a few important considerations to bare in mind.

 1. **Mesh11sd uses the uci utility** to manage dynamic configuration changes, moreover autoconfiguration is done on every startup and is not a one off process.
 2. In normal operation, **configuration changes are not written to the config files in /etc/config** but are kept in volatile storage by way of the uci utility.
 3. **Directly editing a config file will very likely break something**, all manual changes should be done with the uci utility and then only by expert users.
 4. The OpenWrt Luci web interface does not support mesh11sd configuration and will probably not even show its effects. To this end, **Luci is by default disabled by the mesh11sd daemon.** Advanced users can re-enable it later if required (See the mesh11sd command line (CLI) reference later in this document).

## 6. Autoconfig Essentials

We are now ready to start the mesh on our first meshnode and will do so in the mesh11sd safe test mode. If all is well we will commit mesh11sd to auto config on every restart.

We can then move on to configuring the other meshnodes in the same way before placing them in their required locations.

We will do this by making a temporary connection for each node in turn to an upstream Internet connection, connecting its "wan" port to a "lan" port of your isp router.


***Note: Use the same configuration for all nodes, INCLUDING the base ipv4 address (see later).***

By simply enabling auto_config, mesh11sd will attempt to bring up a working meshnode, but there are several essentials that should be configured as the defaults may not be appropriate.
In the worst case this can result in a soft brick condition.
To prevent this, mesh11sd provides an auto config test command.

 1. The country code default setting is DFS-ETSI as it is the "safest", but of course you are legally obliged to set the country code for your locality.
 2. Set the base ipv4 address of the meshnode, defining the subnet to be used on the mesh.
 3. Mesh11sd sets a hashed meshID and meshKey to encrypt the mesh backhaul, but you should set your own seed values to be used, to ensure only your meshnodes can join your mesh. This must be the same on every meshnode.
 4. You should set a WiFi access code and if desired, your own ssid on each gateway node.


Connect your computer by ethernet to a "lan" port of the meshnode you are configuring.

Open a terminal session on the node using SSH to the default ip address of 192.168.1.1

You must now stop the mesh11sd service using the following command:

```
	service mesh11sd stop
```

**Country Code**

This should be set in the normal OpenWrt way, using either the uci utility or the Luci Web UI.

**Base IP Address and Subnet Mask**

This should be set in the normal OpenWrt way, using either the uci utility or the Luci Web UI.

**Mesh Encryption Seed Values**

A mesh ID seed value should be set. For example, using the string "MyMeshIDSeed", run the following command:

```
	uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_mesh_id='MyMeshIDSeed'
```

Optionally add a mesh key seed, eg "MyMeshKeySeed"

```
	uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_mesh_key='MyMeshKeySeed'
```

**Gateway SSID**

This should be set in the normal OpenWrt way, using either the uci utility or the Luci Web UI.

**Gateway Encryption**

First, select the desired encryption type from the following:

`0 (none/owe-transition), 1 (sae, aka wpa3), 2 (sae-mixed, aka wpa2/wpa3), 3 (psk2, aka wpa2) or 4 (owe - Opportunistic Wireless Encryption)`

**Note: Opportunistic Wireless Encryption requires a full version of wpad eg wpad-mbedtls.**

Example, set to psk2 encryption:

```
	uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_encryption='3'
```

Now set the desired access code, eg "mysecretaccesscode":

```
	uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_key='mysecretaccesscode'
```

**Save the Changes**

Finally, save the changes:

```
	uci commit mesh11sd

```

The node can now be moved to the desired location and the next one configured.

Power up all nodes in any order, having one only connected to your isp router as the portal node.


## 7. Meshnode Types:

The mesh can have numerous types of meshnodes.

  * **Peer Node** - the basic mesh peer - capable of mac-routing layer 2 packets in the mesh network.

  * **Gateway Node** - a peer node that also hosts an access point (AP) radio for normal client devices to connect to. Also known as a gate.

  * **Gateway Leech Node** - a special type of Gateway Node that connects to the mesh backhaul but neither contributes to it nor advertises itself on it.

  * **Portal Node** - a peer node that also hosts a layer 3 routed upstream connection (eg an Internet feed)

  * **CPE Gateway Node** A special type of Gateway Node can also function as a CPE (Customer [or Client] Premises Equipment), hosting a downstream layer 3 network with its own unique ipv4 subnet.

  * **Bridge Portal Node** A special type of Portal Node that functions as a bridge rather than a layer 3 router. The WAN port functions as a Trunk port connected to the WAN ports of all the Trunk Peer Nodes on the mesh backhaul.

  * **Trunk Peer Node** A special kind of Peer node That provides a trunk connection from its WAN port to the WAN port of a Bridge Portal Node.

Various combinations are possible, for example it is possible for a Portal node to also be a Gateway node (ie it hosts an AP as well as an upstream connection).

## 8. Auto Channel Tracking:

All Peer nodes will track the wireless channel that the Portal node is using. If the Portal node changes its working channel, this will be detected and tracked autonomously by downstream meshnodes.

The default radio will be on 2.4 GHz but can be changed by means of a simple config option.

2.4 GHz is chosen as it gives the most reliable mesh backhaul due to the range and penetration of the 2.4 GHz spectrum and the fact that it is not effected by the DFS restrictions of other bands. It can also be used unlicensed almost everywhere in outdoor venues. This comes of course with a likely bandwidth compromise, but in practice is often acceptable, particularly in a normal domestic or public environment.

Mesh11sd will add required wireless mesh configuration autonomously and it can be viewed using the uci utility but will not be present in the /etc/config/wireless file.

If the mesh network interface is defined in the wireless configuration file, mesh11sd will attempt to use it, but be warned, this may have very unpredictable results and is not normally recommended.

**NOTE:** ***Mesh11sd cannot be configured using the OpenWrt Luci UI, and its configuration will not appear in the Luci wireless pages, even when mesh11sd is active.***

**NOTE:** It is essential that all meshnodes are configured to use the same radio channel, the same key and the same mesh_id. By default, Mesh11sd will do this for you.

All mesh parameter settings in the config file are dynamic and will take effect immediately.

The option portal_detect much simplifies the setup of the meshnodes of a network. Each can be configured as a basic router with a mesh interface defined as above. Once mesh11sd is installed, portal detection will be activated and with the upstream wan port connected, the meshnode will continue to function as a router with the additional functionality of a mesh portal.

When the upstream wan connection is disconnected, the meshnode will automatically reconfigure itself as a layer 2 peer meshnode.

This means that all meshnodes can be the same basic router configuration and once moved to the required location, will autonomously reconfigure.

Access to the remote meshnode peers will not be possible using the default ipv4 address as this will be disabled. Remote management can be achieved by using the `mesh11sd connect` and `mesh11sd copy` commands, or alternatively by reconnecting the wan port to an upstream feed.


## 10. Setup Options
* enabled - 0=disabled, 1=enabled. Default 1

* debuglevel - 0=silent, 1=notice, 2=info, 3=debug. Default 1

* checkinterval - the interval in seconds after which changes in parameters are detected and activated. Default 10 seconds

* portal_detect (optional) - Ignored if auto_config is disabled.

            Default 1

            Possible values:

            0  - Force ipv4 nat routed Portal mode regardless of an upstream connection.

	        1  - Detect if the meshnode is a portal, meaning it has an upstream wan link.

                 If the upstream link is active, the router hosting the meshnode will serve ipv4 dhcp into the mesh network.

	             If the upstream link is not connected, dhcp will be disabled and the meshnode will function as a layer 2 bridge on the mesh network.

            2  - Deprecated - no longer used - replaced by mode 5.

	        3  - Force CPE mode (Customer Premises Equipment)

	             This is a peer mode but treats the mesh backhaul as an upstream wan connection.
	             A nat routed ipv4 lan is created with its own ipv4 subnet.

	        4  - Force Bridge vxlan trunk portal node

	             This mode should be used if a bridged connection to the upstream ISP router is required (ie bridged/no-nat ipv4 ).

                 Functions in a similar way to 0, but forces BRIDGED rather than routed portal mode, ADDING the wan ethernet port to the vxtunnel bridge (default br-tun69)

	             The wan port will be an ethernet end point into the vxtunnel, supporting vlans if required.

	             The wan port and lan port(s) form independent layer 2 networks carried by the mesh backhaul to all peer meshnodes.

	             The vxlan tunnel can be treated as a separate virtual ethernet tunnel to all mesh nodes.

	             ie the wan port on a mode 4 portal is the end point of a virtual vlan supporting ethernet network connecting to the wan ports of all mode 5 bridge vxlantrunk peer nodes.

	             In normal use, BOTH the wan and a lan port could be patched to the upstream router or an intermediate switch.

             5  - Bridge vxlan trunk peer node

	             Compatible with portal nodes configured with portal_detect 0, 1 or 4.

	             Functions in a similar way to 0, but FORCES peer mode and adds wan ethernet port to the vxtunnel bridge (default br-tun69)

	             The wan port will be an ethernet end point into the vxtunnel, supporting vlans if required.

	             The lan port(s) will be ethernet end points into the mash backhaul and will NOT support vlans.

	             Has no effect if auto_config is disabled.

* portal_channel (optional) Applies to 2.4 GHz band only
             Valid only when the meshnode is a portal.

             If portal_detect is disabled (0), portal_channel can be set to:

	             1. auto - a channel is auto selected

                 2. default - the channel defined in /etc/config/wireless is used

                 3. A valid 2.4 GHz channel (1 to 13, depending on the country setting)

             Default: system default

             All mesh peer and mesh gate nodes will autonomously track the mesh portal channel regardless of the configured auto_mesh_band.

* portal_use_default_ipv4 (optional)
             Effective only if node is a portal

             Default 0

             When set to 1, the default ipv4 address found in /etc/config/network is used

             When set to 0 or not set, an ip subnet address is calulated based on the label mac address

* channel_tracking_checkinterval (optional)

	         The minimum interval in seconds after which channel tracking begins on peer nodes. Values less than checkinterval are ignored.

             Default: 30 seconds

* portal_detect_threshold (optional)

             This controls the portal detect watchdog.

             Sets the number of checkintervals before the portal detect watchdog begins actions to (re)establish a reconnection to a portal.

             Default 10 (watchdog is triggered after 10 iterations)

             If set to 0, the watchdog is never triggered.

             Ignored if auto_config is disabled.

             Each time the peer node fails to detect the portal, a counter is incremented.

             If the threshold is reached, the node will take various actions in an attempt to find the portal.

             If the portal is still not detected, the watchdog will reboot the peer node.

* mesh_path_cost - sets the STP cost of the mesh network.

             Can be set to any value from 0 to 65534. Setting to 0 disables STP.

             Default: 10.

* interface_timeout - the time in seconds that mesh11sd will wait for a mesh interface to establish before continuing.

             Default 10 seconds

* auto_config - (optional) - autonomously configures the mesh network.

             Enables autonomous dynamic mesh configuration.

             Auto configure mesh interfaces in the wireless configuration.

             Default 0 (disabled). Set to 1 to enable.

             When set to 0, the mesh11sd daemon will check for an existing mesh configuration.

             Warning: If an existing mesh configuration is found, it will be honoured even if it is incorrect.

             Manually configuring a mesh can soft brick the router if incorrectly done.

             Auto config can be tested using the command line function 'mesh11sd auto_config test'

             See the documentation for further information (Hint: try 'mesh11sd --help')

* auto_mesh_id - (optional) - specifies a string used to generate the mesh id hash.

             If set, this must be the same on all mesh nodes.

             Default --__

* auto_mesh_band (optional)

             Configure the band to use for the mesh network

             Valid values: 2g, 2g40, 5g, 6g, 60g

             Default 2g40

             If set, it must also be set to the same value on every mesh node

             All mesh peer and mesh gate nodes will autonomously track the mesh portal channel regardless of the configured auto_mesh_band.

* mesh_phy_index (optional)

             If set, it must also be set to the same value on every mesh node

* auto_mesh_network - (optional) - specifies the firewall zone used for the mesh.

             Typical values "lan", "guest" etc.

             This can be set differently on each meshnode as required.

             Firewall zone "wan" is not valid.

             Default lan

* mesh_basename - (optional)

             The first 4 characters after non alphanumerics (ie special characters) are removed are used as the mesh_basename.

             Default 1 (enabled).

             Set to 0 to disable.

             **Note:** If there is an interface level "disable option" (in wireless config), mesh11sd will use that setting.

* mesh_leechmode_enable - Determines whether this node will be a gate only leech node

              A gate only leech node acts as an access point with a mesh backhaul connection, but does not contribute to the mesh.

              This is useful when a node is well within the coverage of 2 or more peer nodes, as otherwise it could create unstable multi hop paths within the backhaul.

              Can also be set dynamically using the command line option 'mesh11sd mesh_leechmode [enable/disable]'

              Default: 0 (disabled).

              Set to 1 to enable (turns off the node's mesh forwarding and HWMP mac-routing).

              Takes effect immediately.

* watchdog_nonvolatile_log - (optional - FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES ONLY).

              This enables logging of the portal detect watchdog actions in non-volatile storage.

              The log file /mesh11sd_log/mesh11sd.log is created.

              THIS OPTION IS FOR PORTAL DETECT WATCHDOG DEBUGGING PURPOSES ONLY.

              IF LEFT ENABLED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME IT MAY CAUSE NONE REPAIRABLE FLASH MEMORY WEAR AND USE UP FREE STORAGE SPACE.

              DISABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEBUGGING OPERATIONS ARE COMPLETE.

* mesh_path_stabilisation - This enables mesh path stabilisation, preventing multi hop path changes due to multipath signal strength jitter.

              Default: 1 (enabled).

              To disable, set to zero.

* reactive_path_stabilisation_threshold (optional)

              If an unstable path to an immediate neighbour node is detected, a counter is incremented each checkinterval while the unstable condition continues.

              Mesh path stabilisation is activated once the counter exceeds the threshold.

              Default: 10 checkinterval periods.

* mesh_mac_forced_forwarding (optional)

              This enables mac forced forwarding on the mesh interface

              Default: 1 (enabled)

              To disable, set to zero

* gateway_proxy_arp (optional)

              This enables proxy arp on the gateway bridge interface

              Default: 1 (enabled)

              To disable, set to zero

* reboot_on_error (optional)

              If the watchdog detects a failure of ipv4 communication with a portal, the daemon will reboot the node

              Default: 1 (enabled)

              To disable, set to 1

* stop_on_error (optional)

              If the watchdog detects a failure of ipv4 communication with a portal, the daemon will go into idle mode.

              This is useful if the meshnode does not have a reset button and a critical error occurs, blocking access

              Default: 0 (disabled)

              To enable, set to 1. This setting will override the reboot_on_error setting


* apmond_enable (optional)

              Enables the access point monitoring daemon

              Assumes the uhttpd and px5g-mbedtls packages are installed, but other portal based https web servers can be used.

              Default: 1 (enabled)

              Data is collected from access point interfaces on this node and sent to the portal node

* apmond_cgi_dir (optional)

              Sets the apmond cgi directory

              Takes effect when this node becomes a portal (portal detect 0, 1 and 4)

              Default: /www/cgi-bin

* mesh_backhaul_led (optional)

              Enables the mesh backhaul heartbeat led indicator

              The led indicator will be on when the mesh interface is up, changing to the Linux heartbeat signal when peer nodes are connected

              Default: auto

              By default, the power or system led will be used if present.

              Other leds can be found listed in /sys/class/leds with the format "color:function"

              Disable this option by setting its value to "none"

              Example, enable the "blue:run" led:

              option mesh_backhaul_led 'blue:run'

              Example, disable the mesh backhaul led:

              option mesh_backhaul_led 'none'

* manage_opennds_startup (optional)

              Enables management of opennds startup

              If opennds is installed, mesh11sd will manage its startup.

              Default: 1 Enabled

              Synchronizes nft rulesets of opennds and mesh11sd

              Disabling may cause crash loops because the opennds gatewayinterface may not be up as mesh11sd starts.

### Footnotes

[^1]: Mesh11sd was originally designed to leverage 802.11s mesh networking at Captive Portal venues but has now been open sourced. It enables easy and automated mesh network operation with multiple mesh nodes. It has a comprehensive CLI based API allowing it to be integrated into typical Captive Portal operations but does not require a Captive Portal to be running.

[^2]: A normally configured user device, such as a phone, tablet, laptop etc., cannot connect to a mesh network. Instead, connection is achieved via a mesh gateway, a special type of mesh device.

[^3]: A mesh is not a solution to enable your user devices to seamlessly roam from one access point to another.  
*It is unfortunate that some manufacturers have used the word “Mesh” for marketing purposes to describe their non-standard, closed source, proprietary “roaming” functionality and this causes great confusion to many people when they enter the world of international standards and open source firmware for their network infrastructure.*  
***The accepted standard for mesh networks is ieee802.11s.***  
***The accepted standard for fast roaming of user devices is ieee802.11r.***  
***These are two completely unrelated standards.***
